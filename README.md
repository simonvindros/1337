## 1337 Code Assignment

Welcome to my code assignment for 1337. I've created a relatively basic API-call and accompanied it with a basic filter of the API-response. 

In this project I have put an emphasis on creating a scale-able structure to mimick that of a larger project: for example, my typography.ts file is very small and it is probably redundant for the project in its current state, however; if this were to potentially grow a somewhat adequate architectural structure would already be in place.

I have chosen a rather modern stack: React, TypeScript and Styled Components are the main ones. These are the ones I am currently most proficient in and hence it made sense to use them. I have room to grow when it comes to TDD and that is the reason why I chose to focus on TypeScript rather than using a test-library for this project. 

Global state-management is handled by React Context as again, I have room to improve when it comes to Redux. 

The HTML is semantic and the CSS modern; the website works on pretty much all resolutions.

And the last feature i've focused on is hosting the webpage on a free public URL: surge.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
